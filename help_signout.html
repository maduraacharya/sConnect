<h1>Sign out after using public computers</h1>

When using public computers like in a library or cybercafe, remember that you may still be signed into any services youâ€™ve been using even after you close the browser. So when using a public computer, be sure to sign out.

If you've forgotten to sign out of another computer, you can sign out of your other sessions by going to the bottom right corner of SCONNECT, clicking Details, and then Sign out all other sessions.
